# 🤖 Emotion-Savvy Language Helper (Beta Prototype)

*"Where AI meets human expression"*

![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Alpha%20Testing-yellowgreen)  
*Note: We're still teaching our AI to better understand emotions!*

## 👋 Welcome Friend!
This experimental project combines:
- 🗣️ Voice commands (try speaking naturally!)
- 😊 Real-time mood detection (yes, it sees your smile!)
- 📚 A self-improving dictionary (it learns from you!)

*Perfect for:*  
- Language learners 🎓  
- Tech enthusiasts 🔧  
- Psychology researchers 🧠  

## 🛠️ Setup Guide

### First-Time Setup
1. **Get the code** *(read-only mode for now)*:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-helper.git
```

2. **Install essentials**:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Add the smile detector file**:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencv/opencv/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_mouth.xml
```

## 🎮 Let's Play!
**Start the helper**:
```bash
python heart_of_the_project.py
```

**Try these real conversations**:  
- *Say:* "How do I say 'hope' in Farsi?"  
- *Smile while asking* → "You seem excited to learn!" 😊  
- *Frown during translation* → "Tough word? Let's break it down..." 🤔  

## 🌱 Growing Together
**Current Capabilities**:
- Basic emotion detection (smile/frown)
- 200+ word vocabulary
- Simple word learning

**Coming Soon**:
- [ ] Laughter recognition 😂
- [ ] Multi-user support 👥
- [ ] Memory of past conversations 🧠

## ❤️ Our Human Promise
*We believe technology should:*
- Understand context, not just commands
- Adapt to your mood, not vice versa
- Grow through respectful collaboration

## 🚧 Important Notes
